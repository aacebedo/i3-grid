# rc file may be in the following paths:
# ~/.config/i3float/floatrc
# ~/.config/floatrc
# ~/.floatrc
# ./.floatrc  --> Same path as script (floatwm.py)

MetaData:
    Name: i3-float-wm
    # We use yaml as the file type (easy to read, standard for most python configs)
    # so we do not have to parse custom rc format.
    ThisFileType: yaml
    Source: floatwm.py
Settings:
# All of the following settings can be overridden on the fly
# via command line args. Ex: python i3float.py --<flag> overrideValue

    # Name of your monitor as recorded by 'i3-msg -t get_outputs'
    # Exclude root displays (ex: xroot-0)
    DisplayMonitors:
        # An array of monitor displays this script
        # will observe when ran (ignores other screens).
        # You should probably put all monitors unless
        # you know what you are doing.
        - "eDP1"
        - "HDMI1"
        - "VGA"
    DefaultGrid:
        # These are the only two grid attributes
        # int (Recommended range: 2-4 for laptops, 2-8 for monitors)
        Rows: 3
        Columns: 3
    GridOffset:
        # Offset from screen borders (useful for polybar, etc.)
        # Order matters here.
        # Offset from top, right, bottom, left (in order)
        # This format is similar to CSS
        # Units: pixels {int}
        - 20 # Top
        - 0 # Right
        - 20 # Bottom
        - 0 # Left

    # Default location to snap window to (if not given on the fly)
    # The grid is read from top to bottom and left to right.
    # 0 is center of the whole screen (no resizing)
    # Every other number is auto-resized, unless auto-resize is also
    # off
    # Default example:
    #  1  |  2  |  3
    #  --------------
    #  4  |  5  |  6
    #  --------------
    #  7  |  8  |  9

    # The percentage of screen the
    # reset function will default the terminal to.
    DefaultResetPercentage: 75

    # If you run floatwm on a non-floating window,
    # it can either prompt you, or automatically
    # convert to float without prompt.
    # boolean: true/false
    AutoConvertToFloat: true

    # If auto resize is true, snapping a window to
    # the target value in the grid will resize it
    # to fit proportional to the grid quadrant.
    # Can be overridden on the fly (call resize
    # function manually)
    # boolean: true/false
    AutoResize: true

    # Default port for listenening and sending
    # floatwm data. Can be used for additional scripting
    # Ex: Call a script when the socket sends a specific message.
    # Default if not specifed: 65433
    SocketPort: 65433
