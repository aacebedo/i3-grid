# rc file may be in the following paths:
# ~/.config/i3float/floatrc
# ~/.config/floatrc
# ~/.floatrc
# ./.floatrc  --> Same path as script (floatwm.py)

MetaData:
    Main: i3-float-wm
    # We use yaml as the file type (easy to read, standard for most python configs)
    # so we do not have to parse custom rc format.
    ThisFileType: yaml
    Source: floatwm.py
Settings:
# All of the following settings can be overridden on the fly
# via command line args. Ex: python i3float.py --<flag> overrideValue

    # Name of your monitor as recorded by 'i3-msg -t get_outputs'
    # Exclude root displays (ex: xroot-0)
    DisplayMonitors:
        # An array of monitor displays this script
        # will observe when ran (ignores other screens).
        # You should probably put all monitors unless
        # you know what you are doing.

        - "HDMI1"

        # int
        Rows: 3
        Columns: 3

    # it can either prompt you, or automatically
    # convert to float without prompt.
    # boolean: true/false
    AutoConvertToFloat: false

    # If auto resize is true, snapping a window to
    # the target value in the grid will resize it
    # to fit proportional to the grid quadrant.
    # Can be overridden on the fly (call resize
    # function manually)
    # boolean: true/false
    AutoResize: false

    # Default location to snap window to (if not given on the fly)
    # The grid is read from top to bottom and left to right.
    # 0 is center of the whole screen (no resizing)
    # Every other number is auto-resized, unless auto-resize is also
    # off
