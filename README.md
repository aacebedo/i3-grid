# i3 Floating WM

i3, our beloved window manager, is just that. A window manager. It lets the user handle the floating components themselves. This results in personalized scripts scattered throughout GitHub without a standardized manner to combat floating windows. Not for long! This script aims to allow for fast floating window management with minimal input. Oh yeah, it's also monitor agnostic!
